This Section 2.1(a) applies only to an Individual Customer whose License and Activation Key issued by FIGUINHA specifies the “License Type” as “Single User”. A Single-User license is for a named individual who is identified as the only Authorized User. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, FIGUINHA grants to Customer a non-assignable, nontransferable license, without the right to sublicense, to use the Licensed Software, in object-code form only, solely for Customer’s internal business, research, or educational purposes, and solely by the Individual Customer. The Individual Customer may install up to three (3) copies of the Licensed Software, provided that the Individual Customer is the sole user of each copy.

2.2 Restrictions.
Customer shall not, nor permit any person (including any Authorized User) to: (i) reverse engineer, reverse compile, decrypt, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of the Licensed Software (except to the extent that this restriction is expressly prohibited by law); (ii) modify, translate, or create derivative works of the Licensed Software; (iii) sublicense, resell, rent, lease, distribute, market, commercialize, or otherwise transfer rights or usage to the Licensed Software (except as expressly permitted under this Agreement); (iv) remove, modify, or obscure any copyright notices or other proprietary notices or legends appearing on or in the Licensed Software, or any portion thereof; (v) transfer, use, or export the Licensed Software in violation of any applicable laws, rules, or regulations of any government or governmental agency; (vi) use the Licensed Software or any system services accessed through the Licensed Software to disrupt, disable, or otherwise harm the operations, software, hardware, equipment, and/or systems of a business, institution, or other entity, including, without limitation, exposing the business, institution, or other entity to any computer virus, trojan horse, or other harmful, disruptive, or unauthorized component; or (vii) embed the Licensed Software in any third-party applications, unless otherwise authorized in writing in advance by an officer of FIGUINHA.

2.3 Ownership.
The Licensed Software, FIGUINHA, and Documentation contain copyrighted material and other proprietary material and information of FIGUINHA and/or its licensors. FIGUINHA and/or its licensors shall retain all right, title, and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the Licensed Software, FIGUINHA Enhancements, and Documentation. Customer will not remove, alter, or destroy any form of copyright notice, proprietary markings, or confidential legends placed upon or contained within the Licensed Software, FIGUINHA Enhancements, or Documentation, or any component thereof.

3. TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND UPGRADES AND UPDATES.
3.1 Technical Support.
FIGUINHA agrees to provide Customer with technical support services which include periodic distribution of bug fixes and minor enhancements as Updates scheduled by FIGUINHA. All registered users of the then-current release of Stata and the previous release of Stata are eligible for free limited technical support. Installation support inquiries by telephone will be accepted by FIGUINHA during normal business hours. Technical support email inquiries are accepted at any time and will be answered during normal FIGUINHA business hours. FIGUINHA will attempt to respond to inquiries within the same business day.

3.2 Updates and Upgrades.
To receive and use an Upgrade, Customer must pay the applicable fees for that Upgrade and agree to FIGUINHA’s standard terms and conditions governing the use of that Upgrade. If no such standard terms and conditions are stated by FIGUINHA, the terms of this Agreement shall apply and the Upgrade shall be deemed Licensed Software. FIGUINHA will issue a new Activation Key for the Upgrade. For a Single-User license, once FIGUINHA issues the new Activation Key for an Upgrade version, Customer shall be able to continue to use the prior version of the Licensed Software. For Network, Compute Server, and Student Lab licenses, once FIGUINHA issues the new Activation Key for an Upgrade, Customer shall be able to continue to use the prior version of the Licensed Software on the condition that the total, combined number of Concurrent Authorized Users who are using the Licensed Software (either the prior version, Upgrade, or both) does not exceed the specific number of Concurrent Authorized Users for which Customer has paid the applicable fee. For a Single-User license, technical support services are provided only for the Customer of the then-current version of the Licensed Software. For any other type of license selected by Customer (i.e., Network, Compute Server, or Student Lab), technical support services are provided only for the Authorized Users of the then-current version of the Licensed Software.

4. LIMITED WARRANTY; WARRANTY DISCLAIMER.

4.1 No Disabling Code.
With respect to the Licensed Software (including any Updates or Upgrades) and as of the date of delivery, FIGUINHA represents and warrants that (i) it has used commercially reasonable efforts consistent with industry standards to scan for and remove any software viruses, and (ii) it has not inserted any Disabling Code. “Disabling Code” means computer code inserted by FIGUINHA that is not addressed in the Documentation and that is designed to delete, interfere with, or disable the normal operation of the Products. This Disabling Code warranty does not apply to FIGUINHA passwords necessary for the operation of the Licensed Software, to the Licensed Software’s Activation Key requirement, or for any use by Customer outside the scope of the license.

4.2 No Warranty.
EXCEPT FOR THE WARRANTIES ABOVE, THE LICENSED SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTATION, AND SUPPORT SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO CUSTOMER ON AN ‘AS IS’ AND ‘WHERE IS’ BASIS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY TYPE OR KIND.
