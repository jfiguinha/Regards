// This is a base class for QPDF Document Helper classes. Document
// helpers are classes that provide a convenient, higher-level API for
// accessing document-level structures with a PDF file. Document
// helpers are always initialized with a reference to a QPDF object,
// and the object can always be retrieved. The intention is that you
// may freely intermix use of document helpers with the underlying
// QPDF object unless there is a specific comment in a specific helper
// method that says otherwise. The pattern of using helper objects was
// introduced to allow creation of higher level helper functions
// without polluting the public interface of QPDF.
