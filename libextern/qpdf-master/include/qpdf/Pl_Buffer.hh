// This pipeline accumulates the data passed to it into a memory
// buffer.  Each subsequent use of this buffer appends to the data
// accumulated so far.  getBuffer() may be called only after calling
// finish() and before calling any subsequent write().  At that point,
// a dynamically allocated Buffer object is returned and the internal
// buffer is reset.  The caller is responsible for deleting the
// returned Buffer.
//
// For this pipeline, "next" may be null.  If a next pointer is
// provided, this pipeline will also pass the data through to it.
