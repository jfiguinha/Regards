===============

QPDF was originally created in 2001 and modified periodically between
2001 and 2005 during my employment at `Apex CoVantage
<https://apexcovantage.com/>`__. Upon my departure from Apex, the
company graciously allowed me to take ownership of the software and
continue maintaining it as an open source project, a decision for which I
am very grateful. I have made considerable enhancements to it since
that time. I feel fortunate to have worked for people who would make
such a decision. This work would not have been possible without their
support.

In 2020, I joined `Advent Health Partners <https://adventhp.com/>`__,
which has sponsored some previous QPDF work and generously allows me
to spend some "company time" maintaining QPDF.
