QPDF is completely relocatable. To use qpdf.exe or the qpdf DLL, just
have the bin directory in your path. To compile with qpdf, just add
the lib directory to your library path and the include directory to
your include path. If you are going to use Pl_DCT in your code, you
will also need to have jpeg library development files in your build
environment. Detailed documentation may be found in the doc directory.

Enjoy!
