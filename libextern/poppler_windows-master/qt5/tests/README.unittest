The unittests for the Qt5 bindings rely on the QtTestLib package, and
will not be built until this is installed. If you do not have it, then
you can download it from the Trolltech website.

Note that there are a range of ways in which you can run the tests:
1. "make check" will run all the tests.
2. You can run a single test by executing the applicable
executable. For example, you can run the PageMode tests by
"./check_pagemode"
3. You can run a single function within a single test by appending the
name of the function to the executable. For example, if you just want
to run the FullScreen test within the PageMode tests, you can
"./check_pagemode checkFullScreen". Run the executable with -functions
to get a list of all the functions.
4. You can run a single function  with specific data by appending the
name of the function, followed by a colon, then the data label to the
executable. For example, to just do the Author check within the
metadata checks, you can "./check_metadata checkStrings:Author".

For a full list of options, run a executable with "-help".
